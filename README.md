Learning element:
I used scripting for this animation and also just basic animation and these were very hard to learn for the sake of having them be timed at the time they are needed to perform an animation. I had to learn about the animatio controller tranistions and how to use them to make the animations occur at a specific moment. I then learned how to use scripting to keep treack of a time variable and use that to my advantage to add constraints in the animation controller to easily make the animation occur at a specific moment
